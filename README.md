## Introduction

This is the first of two projects in the Exploratory Data Analysis Coursera Course offered
by Johns Hopkins University.

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]



## Running the Scripts and Viewing Figures


The four scripts can be run by sourcing each individual .R file in R. 
Alternatively, the created .png files for each script can also be found in this repo.
