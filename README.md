## Introduction

This is the first of two projects in the Exploratory Data Analysis Coursera Course offered
by Johns Hopkins University.

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. Specifically, this project uses the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set." 


## Running the Scripts and Viewing Figures

Download "household_power_consumption.txt" using the above link as well as the four .R
scripts, all of which are located in this repo. Be sure to change your current directory 
to your working directory first before running each script. Run each script by running 
the source() function in R.

Alternatively, the created .png files for each script can also be found in this repo and
viewed directly.
